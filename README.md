# auto_ml

In the repository we test auto-ml python packages with focus on time-series forecasting

**Packages**
1. Facebook Prophet (https://github.com/facebook/prophet)
2. PyFlux (https://github.com/RJT1990/pyflux)
3. Pyramid (https://github.com/tgsmith61591/pyramid)
4. PyAF (https://github.com/antoinecarme/pyaf)
5. pydlm (https://github.com/wwrechard/pydlm)
6. Auto-sklearn (https://github.com/automl/auto-sklearn)
7. auto-ml (https://github.com/ClimbsRocks/auto_ml)
8. MLBox (https://github.com/AxeldeRomblay/MLBox)
9. TPOT (https://github.com/EpistasisLab/tpot)

In the **folder AirlinesTesting** we add experiments on real Airlines passengers dataset of the following libraries:
1. Prophet
2. Pyramid
3. PyFlux
4. PyAF
5. NN on Keras

In the folder **Rossman_sales_automl** we add auto ml solutions of the TPOT and Auto-sklearn on the Kaggle competition  "Rossmann store sales" (https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales)

In the folder **Synthetic_tests_final** we add experiments on synthetic datasets (our auto training, prediction and plotting  approach) of the following libraries:
1. Prophet
2. Pyramid

In the folders **Prophet_analysis** and **Prophet_Pyramid_parameters_analyzing** we add step-by-step explanation of final formulas for prediction of Prophet and Pyramid packages.

In the folder **tsfresh_explore** we add notebooks with our introduction to tsfresh library and some experiments on synthetic dataset and Rossmann Dataset with Prophet + tsfresh and Pyramid + tsfresh. In the folder some notebooks with experiments on tsfresh + lags and LR + lags are also added.

In the folder **rnn** we add code for rnn.

In the folder **presentations** we add all our presentations that were prepared during our Internship.
